Name: Spring Boot Maven Plugin
Description: Spring Boot Maven Plugin
Group Id: org.springframework.boot
Artifact Id: spring-boot-maven-plugin
Version: 2.1.4.RELEASE
Goal Prefix: spring-boot

This plugin has 6 goals:

spring-boot:build-info
  Description: Generate a build-info.properties file based the content of the
    current MavenProject.
  Implementation: org.springframework.boot.maven.BuildInfoMojo
  Language: java
  Bound to phase: generate-resources

  Available parameters:

    additionalProperties
      Additional properties to store in the build-info.properties. Each entry
      is prefixed by build. in the generated build-info.properties.

    outputFile (Default:
    ${project.build.outputDirectory}/META-INF/build-info.properties)
      The location of the generated build-info.properties.

spring-boot:help
  Description: Display help information on spring-boot-maven-plugin.
    Call mvn spring-boot:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=<goal-name> to display
    parameter details.
  Implementation: org.springframework.boot.maven.HelpMojo
  Language: java

  Available parameters:

    detail (Default: false)
      User property: detail
      If true, display all settable properties for each goal.

    goal
      User property: goal
      The name of the goal for which to show help. If unspecified, all goals
      will be displayed.

    indentSize (Default: 2)
      User property: indentSize
      The number of spaces per indentation level, should be positive.

    lineLength (Default: 80)
      User property: lineLength
      The maximum length of a display line, should be positive.

spring-boot:repackage
  Description: Repackages existing JAR and WAR archives so that they can be
    executed from the command line using java -jar. With layout=NONE can also
    be used simply to package a JAR with nested dependencies (and no main
    class, so not executable).
  Implementation: org.springframework.boot.maven.RepackageMojo
  Language: java
  Bound to phase: package

  Available parameters:

    attach (Default: true)
      Attach the repackaged archive to be installed and deployed.

    classifier
      Classifier to add to the repackaged archive. If not given, the main
      artifact will be replaced by the repackaged archive. If given, the
      classifier will also be used to determine the source archive to
      repackage: if an artifact with that classifier already exists, it will be
      used as source and replaced. If no such artifact exists, the main
      artifact will be used as source and the repackaged archive will be
      attached as a supplemental artifact with that classifier. Attaching the
      artifact allows to deploy it alongside to the original one, see the maven
      documentation for more details.

    embeddedLaunchScript
      The embedded launch script to prepend to the front of the jar if it is
      fully executable. If not specified the 'Spring Boot' default script will
      be used.

    embeddedLaunchScriptProperties
      Properties that should be expanded in the embedded launch script.

    excludeDevtools (Default: true)
      Exclude Spring Boot devtools from the repackaged archive.

    excludeGroupIds
      User property: spring-boot.excludeGroupIds
      Comma separated list of groupId names to exclude (exact match).

    excludes
      User property: spring-boot.excludes
      Collection of artifact definitions to exclude. The Exclude element
      defines a groupId and artifactId mandatory properties and an optional
      classifier property.

    executable (Default: false)
      Make a fully executable jar for *nix machines by prepending a launch
      script to the jar.
      Currently, some tools do not accept this format so you may not always be
      able to use this technique. For example, jar -xf may silently fail to
      extract a jar or war that has been made fully-executable. It is
      recommended that you only enable this option if you intend to execute it
      directly, rather than running it with java -jar or deploying it to a
      servlet container.

    includes
      User property: spring-boot.includes
      Collection of artifact definitions to include. The Include element
      defines a groupId and artifactId mandatory properties and an optional
      classifier property.

    includeSystemScope (Default: false)
      Include system scoped dependencies.

    layout
      The type of archive (which corresponds to how the dependencies are laid
      out inside it). Possible values are JAR, WAR, ZIP, DIR, NONE. Defaults to
      a guess based on the archive type.

    layoutFactory
      The layout factory that will be used to create the executable archive if
      no explicit layout is set. Alternative layouts implementations can be
      provided by 3rd parties.

    mainClass
      The name of the main class. If not specified the first compiled class
      found that contains a 'main' method will be used.

    outputDirectory (Default: ${project.build.directory})
      Required: true
      Directory containing the generated archive.

    requiresUnpack
      A list of the libraries that must be unpacked from fat jars in order to
      run. Specify each library as a <dependency> with a <groupId> and a
      <artifactId> and they will be unpacked at runtime.

    skip (Default: false)
      User property: spring-boot.repackage.skip
      Skip the execution.

spring-boot:run
  Description: Run an executable archive application.
  Implementation: org.springframework.boot.maven.RunMojo
  Language: java
  Bound to phase: validate
  Before this mojo executes, it will call:
    Phase: 'test-compile'

  Available parameters:

    addResources (Default: false)
      User property: spring-boot.run.addResources
      Add maven resources to the classpath directly, this allows live in-place
      editing of resources. Duplicate resources are removed from target/classes
      to prevent them to appear twice if ClassLoader.getResources() is called.
      Please consider adding spring-boot-devtools to your project instead as it
      provides this feature and many more.
